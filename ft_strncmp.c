	 * We set i to 0 to place us at the beginning of our string when we start our
	 * loop. We then check to see if our given n is equal to 0. If it is we
	 * return 0. If not we begin our loop which requires three conditions to be
	 * true in order to happen. We want our loop to happen as long as our string
	 * has not reached it's end AND while the character at position i in s1 is
	 * the same as the character at position i in s2 AND while our counter 
	 * variable i is less than n - 1. We subtract 1 from the given n because
	 * a size_t variable is often used for a memory allocation function and will
	 * be the full size of the string. We subtract 1 to compensate for the fact
	 * that the given size_t is not supposed to be given as 0. If we find a 
	 * difference in characters, or our i variable becomes the same size as n
	 * minus 1, or we reach the end of s1, we finish the loop. We then return
	 * the difference between the current character in s1 at position i from the
	 * current character in s2 at position i. NOTE: We cast the characters as
	 * unsigned characters just like the man explained.
